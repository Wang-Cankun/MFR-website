	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

		  <h1>Intro</h1>
	    <p>Measuring relatedness between a pair of genes under certain conditions is a fundamental technique and still a big challenge in computational biology. Traditionally, such relatedness can be assessed using co-expression similarities. However, they are known for high positive false rates, which severely impact the results of further computational analysis and biological interpretations. In addition, the other type of features, prior-knowledge based similarities, are only viable for measuring general relatedness, because the experiments where the prior knowledge is obtained are usually conducted in a common environment. </p>
	    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To solve the problem, we propose a novel machine learning  model for accurately measuring relatedness between genes under given specific  conditions, by organically combining expression similarities and  prior-knowledge based similarities in a novel assessment criterion:  Multi-Features Relatedness (MFR).  Only gene pairs with both high expression similarities and high prior-knowledge  based similarities will be kept and recommended by our model. Intuitively, this  fits a multi-objective <a name="OLE_LINK12"></a>regression problem. We use <abbr title="Support Vector Machine">SVM</abbr> with linear kernel to effectively solve this regression problem,  after transforming it to a single-objective generalized linear logit regression  problem with the following hypotheses: (i) fitting of relatedness supported by  expression similarities is equal to fitting of relatedness supported by  prior-knowledge based similarities; (ii) all features contribute to fitting on  the same level; and (iii) the fitting target relatedness are 0/1 (non-interacting/interacting). </p>
	    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Compared with other linear models (<abbr title="Logistic Regression">logist</abbr>, <abbr title="Linear Discriminant Analysis">LDA</abbr>) and co-expression analysis methods (<abbr title= "Pearson Correlation Coefficient">PPC</abbr>, <abbr title="Spearman Rank Correlation">SRC</abbr>, <abbr title="Partial Pearson Correlation">PPC</abbr>, <abbr title="Mutual Information">MI</abbr> and <abbr title="Conditional Mutual Information">CMI</abbr>), the performance of <abbr title="Multi-Features Relatedness">MFR</abbr> model significantly improve the precision, robustness, practicability of measuring relatedness of gene pairs under given certain conditions.</p>

       <h1>Workflow</h1>
       <p>The whole workflow of <abbr title="Multi-Feature Relatedness">MFR</abbr> model has five major steps (see Figure 1), including (i) gene pair samples collection from three different databases and a benchmark dataset of a published study; (ii) gene features extraction from three databases for assessing similarity-based gene pair features; (iii) totally 12 similarity-based gene pair features calculation using four gene features and two databases; (iv) <abbr title="Support Vector Machine">SVM</abbr>-based model construction in a 10-fold cross validation, where our model was trained and tested repeatedly in 10 times; and (v) application of the trained model to detect gene-gene interactions in verification datasets, construct cancer gene network, and predict gene function. The results were compared with other linear models and co-expression analysis methods.</p>

		  <h1>Results</h1>
		  <p><abbr title="Multi-Feature Relatedness">MFR</abbr> model is applied to predict gene-gene interactions extracted from the <a href="http://coxpresdb.jp">COXPRESdb</a>, <a href="http://www.kegg.jp">KEGG</a> and <a href="http://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/">TRRUST</a> databases and the dataset of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Large-Scale+Prediction+of+Human+Proteinâˆ’Protein+Interactions+from+Amino+Acid+Sequence+Based+on+Latent+Topic+Features">Pan et al.'s study</a> in a 10-fold cross validation (see Figure 2), and to identify gene-gene interactions collected from the <a href="http://www.genefriends.org">geneFirends</a> and <a href="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Main.cgi">DIP</a> databases in verification (see Figure 3). The results show that, compared with other linear models and co-expression analysis methods, the performance of <abbr title="Multi-Feature Relatedness">MFR</abbr> model significantly improve the precision and robustness of measuring relatedness between genes. In terms of cancer gene network construction (see Figure 4) and gene function prediction (see Figure 5), <abbr title="Multi-Feature Relatedness">MFR</abbr> model also obtains the results with more biological significances and accuracies than other compared models and methods.</p>
