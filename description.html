	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

		  <h1>Intro</h1>
	    <p> &nbsp; Measuring conditional relatedness between a pair of genes is a fundamental technique and still a significant challenge in computational biology. Traditionally, such relatedness can be assessed using expression similarities. However, they are known for high false positive rates. Also, the other type of features, prior-knowledge based similarities, is only viable for measuring global relatedness. </p>
	    <p> &nbsp; To solve the problem, we propose a novel machine learning model for accurately measuring conditional relatedness between a pair of genes, by integrating expression similarities and prior-knowledge based similarities in an assessment criterion: Multi-Features Relatedness (MFR). Only gene pairs with both high expression similarities and high prior-knowledge based similarities will be kept and recommended by our model. Intuitively, this fits a multi-objective regression problem. We use <abbr title="Support Vector Machine">SVM</abbr> with linear kernel to effectively solve this regression problem, after transforming it to a single-objective generalized linear logit regression problem with the following hypotheses: (i) fitting of relatedness supported by expression similarities is equal to fitting of relatedness supported by prior-knowledge based similarities; (ii) all features contribute to fitting on the same level; and (iii) the fitting target relatedness are 0/1 (non-interacting/interacting).&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The results show that MFR wins the highest area under curve (AUC) value for identifying gene-gene interactions in development, test and DIP datasets, and specially obtains an improvement on average of precision for detecting gene pairs with both high expression similarities and high prior-knowledge based similarities in all datasets, comparing to other linear models and coexpression analysis methods. Regarding cancer gene network construction and gene function prediction, MFR model also obtains the results with more biological significances and higher average prediction accuracy, than other compared models and methods</p>

       <h1>Workflow</h1>
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five major steps in the whole workflow of <abbr title="Multi-Feature Relatedness">MFR</abbr> model as shown in Figure 1, including (i) gene pair samples collected from three different databases and a benchmark dataset of a published study; (ii) gene features extraction from three databases for assessing similarity-based gene pair features; (iii) totally 12 similarity-based gene pair features calculation using four gene features and two databases; (iv) <abbr title="Support Vector Machine">SVM</abbr>-based model construction by 3-fold cross-validation, where our model is repeatedly trained by 60% gene pairs and developed by other 30% in 3*3 times; and (v) application of the developed model to detect gene-gene interactions in the rest 10% gene pairs and the other two verification datasets, construct cancer gene network, and predict gene function. The results are compared with other linear models and coexpression analysis methods.</p>
